When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	when colaborating with other people, or sometimes I work on proyects from the office and home but in different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	because you only want to publish the changes that release a complete functionality

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks are a clone made directly from github from remote to remote, clones get a complete copy of a repository, and a branch is just an alternative copy of the proyect with other funcionality or diferent aproach, we use clone to get a copy from the remote to local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	you can have the latest changes your collaborators push to merge them into your own changes, and keep an up to date version

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	One way I've used is to share a folder on dropbox with the main folder and talking trough skype, but we need a lot of comunication to keep everything correct.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	Every time we make a new feature or incorporate new logic is good to use a branch, and for changes like typos, chores, and docs can be made directly into master.
